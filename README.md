# minefield-game
Project carried out as part of the Programming Language course [2018.2].

* First version (part I) <br />
 Developed the interaction menus and the beginning phase of the game. In this phase, the mines are distributed randomly, you can get the number of neighboring mines, and open the squares (one at a time) where there are no mines.
* Second version (part II) <br />
 The intermediate phase and the customized phase have been developed. The function of opening the squares was implemented with recursion, in case there are no mines in the neighborhood; information was also implemented about the time and number of mines in the match, conditions in case the player wins or loses the match, and the visualization of the field with information.
* Final version (part III) <br />
 The game code has been completed and functions have been implemented to read and write files with the best times from the beginner and intermediate phases.
